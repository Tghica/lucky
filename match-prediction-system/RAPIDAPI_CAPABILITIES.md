## ❌ What RapidAPI CANNOT Provide

### Match Statistics (Detailed)
Based on our analysis and the existing code, **detailed match statistics are NOT reliably available**:

- ❌ Aces, Double Faults (per match)
- ❌ 1st/2nd serve percentages
- ❌ Break points saved/faced
- ❌ Total service points
- ❌ Winners, Unforced Errors
- ❌ Match duration (minutes)

**Evidence from our data**:
- 2025 ATP Daily Update: 2,366 matches with **0% service statistics**
- Historical data from Jeff Sackmann has 88% service stats coverage
- RapidAPI focuses on results/odds, not detailed match statistics

### Other Limitations
- ❌ Historical data older than ~2-3 years
- ❌ Challenger/ITF level match statistics
- ❌ Practice match data
- ❌ Detailed injury reports
- ❌ Player form/fitness indicators

## 🎯 Best Use Cases for RapidAPI

### 1. ✅ EXCELLENT FOR: Live Match Prediction
**What we need**: Upcoming matches with betting odds
```python
# Get next week's matches
endpoint = '/tennis/v2/atp/fixtures/2025-10-29/2025-11-05'
# Returns: player names, tournament, surface, odds
```

**Value Add**:
- Real-time betting odds for calibration
- Tournament context (level, surface)
- Player rankings and metadata
- H2H history for feature engineering

### 2. ✅ GOOD FOR: Filling Missing Player Data
**What we're missing in 2025 data**:
- Winner/loser IDs: 100% missing
- Winner/loser height: 100% missing
- Winner/loser country: 100% missing

**RapidAPI can provide**:
```python
# Get player details
endpoint = '/tennis/v2/player/{player_id}'
# Returns: height, country, hand, age, ranking
```

### 3. ✅ GOOD FOR: Ranking Updates
**What we have**: 98-99% ranking coverage in historical data
**What we need**: Current rankings for predictions

```python
# Get current ATP rankings
endpoint = '/tennis/v2/atp/rankings'
# Returns: Live rankings, points, movement
```

### 4. ✅ GOOD FOR: Tournament Surface Mapping
**What we built**: Manual tournament-to-surface mapping
**RapidAPI provides**: Automatic surface detection per tournament

### 5. ❌ NOT USEFUL FOR: Service Statistics
- RapidAPI doesn't provide detailed match statistics
- We already have 88% coverage from Jeff Sackmann (2000-2024)
- For 2025 predictions, we'll need to use player averages from historical data

## 💡 Recommended Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Player Metadata Enrichment (Week 1)
**Goal**: Fill missing 2025 player data

```python
# For each unique player in 2025 data (2,366 matches)
# Fetch player details: height, country, hand, age
# Expected: ~500 unique players = ~500 API calls
```

**Benefit**:
- Complete player physical features
- Enable height_diff, age_diff features
- Match player countries to tournament locations

### Phase 2: Live Predictions (Week 2+)
**Goal**: Predict upcoming matches with betting odds

```python
# Weekly fetch upcoming matches
endpoint = '/tennis/v2/atp/fixtures/{next_week}'
# Expected: ~20 requests/week (16 with cache)
```

**Benefit**:
- Get live odds for model calibration
- Real-time predictions for betting
- Tournament context for features

### Phase 3: Historical Gaps (Optional)
**Goal**: Fill specific missing data points

- Missing rankings: Use rankings endpoint
- Missing surfaces: Use tournament endpoint
- H2H verification: Use h2h endpoint

## 📈 API Usage Budget

### Conservative Plan (Within 500/month limit)

**Month 1 Setup**:
- Player metadata enrichment: 500 players = 500 calls
- Total: 500 calls (100% of quota)

**Month 2+ Weekly Updates**:
- Weekly fixtures fetch: ~20 calls/week
- Monthly total: ~80 calls (16% of quota)
- Remaining: 420 calls for ad-hoc queries

### Recommended Schedule

**One-time**:
- ✅ Fetch all player metadata (500 calls, Month 1)

**Ongoing**:
- ✅ Weekly fixture updates (20 calls/week)
- ✅ Monthly ranking refresh (1 call/month)
- ✅ Ad-hoc H2H queries (as needed)

## 🔧 Implementation Priority

### HIGH PRIORITY ⭐
1. **Player metadata fetch** - Fills 100% missing 2025 data
2. **Weekly fixture fetch** - Enables live predictions
3. **Betting odds integration** - Model calibration feature

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. **Rankings refresh** - Keeps rankings current
5. **H2H queries** - Enhances H2H features
6. **Tournament details** - Better surface mapping

### LOW PRIORITY
7. **Historical backfill** - We have Jeff Sackmann data
8. **Service stats** - Not available via API
