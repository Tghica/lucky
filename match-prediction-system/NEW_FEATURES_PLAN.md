# New Features to Add - Enhancement Plan

## üéØ High Priority Features (Should Definitely Add)

### 1. Betting Market Features (NEW DATA SOURCE!)
**Source:** ATP Tennis 2000-2025 Daily Update has betting odds!

```python
# From Odd_1 and Odd_2 columns
- implied_probability_p1        # 1 / Odd_1
- implied_probability_p2        # 1 / Odd_2
- odds_diff                     # Odd_1 - Odd_2
- odds_ratio                    # Odd_1 / Odd_2
- market_favorite               # Binary: is player1 favorite?
- odds_elo_agreement            # Do odds agree with our ELO prediction?
- odds_elo_divergence           # How much do they differ?
- market_confidence             # Lower odds = higher market confidence
- value_bet_p1                  # Our probability vs market probability
- value_bet_p2                  # Our probability vs market probability
```

**Why Important:**
- Betting markets aggregate expert opinions
- Can calibrate our predictions against real-world probabilities
- Could boost accuracy by 2-5%
- Helps identify when our model disagrees with consensus

### 2. Enhanced Ranking Features
**Source:** Jeff Sackmann has ranking_date, rank, points

```python
# Current features only use rank at match time
- player1_ranking_trend_30d     # Is ranking improving/declining?
- player2_ranking_trend_30d     
- player1_ranking_trend_90d     # Longer term trend
- player2_ranking_trend_90d
- ranking_points_diff           # More granular than rank
- ranking_volatility_p1         # How stable is their ranking?
- ranking_volatility_p2
- career_high_rank_p1           # Peak ranking
- career_high_rank_p2
- weeks_at_current_rank_p1      # Consistency
- weeks_at_current_rank_p2
- rank_momentum_diff            # Combined ranking trajectory
```

**Why Important:**
- A player rising from #50 to #30 is different from falling #30 to #50
- Captures player trajectory/momentum
- Old model only used static rank at match time

---

### 3. Advanced Surface Specialization
**Current:** Binary specialist flag (not used by model!)

```python
# New approach with granularity
- player1_surface_win_pct       # Win % on this surface
- player2_surface_win_pct
- player1_surface_matches       # Experience on surface
- player2_surface_matches
- surface_experience_diff       # Who's more experienced?
- player1_recent_surface_form   # Last 10 matches on this surface
- player2_recent_surface_form
- surface_transition            # Coming from different surface?
- player1_clay_hard_ratio       # Surface versatility
- player2_clay_hard_ratio
- indoor_outdoor_factor         # Court environment
```

**Why Important:**
- Some players dominate on clay but struggle on hard
- Better than binary specialist flag
- Accounts for surface transitions (clay season ‚Üí hard court)

---

### 4. Match Context & Scheduling
**Source:** Available from tourney data

```python
# Tournament progression
- round_number                  # R32=1, R16=2, QF=3, SF=4, F=5
- matches_to_title              # How many wins needed?
- prize_money_difference        # Stakes of this match
- knockout_pressure             # Grand Slam vs ATP 250

# Scheduling pressure
- matches_in_last_7_days        # Tournament congestion
- matches_in_last_14_days
- back_to_back_days             # Played yesterday?
- triple_threat_week            # 3 matches in week?
- travel_burden                 # Different continent last week?

# Tournament phase
- early_round                   # Round 1-2 (upsets more likely)
- late_round                    # QF, SF, F (favorites stronger)
- defending_champion_p1         # Extra pressure
- defending_champion_p2
```

**Why Important:**
- Favorites are stronger in later rounds
- Scheduling density affects performance
- Context matters: Grand Slam final ‚â† ATP 250 first round

---

### 5. Enhanced Head-to-Head
**Current:** Basic H2H wins/matches (low importance in old model)

```python
# Make H2H more useful
- h2h_on_this_surface           # H2H record on current surface
- h2h_in_last_year              # Recent H2H (more relevant)
- h2h_at_this_tournament        # Venue-specific H2H
- h2h_streak                    # Current win streak in H2H
- h2h_decisive_sets             # How close are their matches?
- h2h_avg_set_diff              # Dominance level
- h2h_recency_weighted          # Weight recent matches more
- psychological_edge            # Consistent winner in H2H
```

**Why Important:**
- Some matchups are psychological (Nadal vs Federer on clay)
- Recent H2H more relevant than 5 years ago
- Surface-specific H2H is key

---

### 6. Service & Return Statistics
**Source:** Jeff Sackmann has w_ace, w_df, w_svpt, w_1stIn, etc.

```python
# Service game strength
- player1_avg_aces_per_match    # Rolling average
- player2_avg_aces_per_match
- player1_avg_df_per_match      # Double faults
- player2_avg_df_per_match
- player1_1st_serve_pct         # Service consistency
- player2_1st_serve_pct
- player1_1st_serve_win_pct     # Service effectiveness
- player2_1st_serve_win_pct
- player1_break_points_saved    # Pressure handling
- player2_break_points_saved

# Return game strength  
- player1_return_points_won     # Return ability
- player2_return_points_won
- player1_break_points_converted
- player2_break_points_converted

# Matchup advantages
- service_game_diff             # Who has better serve?
- return_game_diff              # Who returns better?
- serve_return_balance          # Overall advantage
```

**Why Important:**
- Tennis is won on serve/return
- Big servers have advantage on fast courts
- Good returners neutralize big servers
- Surface impacts these stats

---

### 7. Match Duration & Stamina
**Source:** minutes column in Jeff Sackmann data

```python
- player1_avg_match_duration    # How long their matches last
- player2_avg_match_duration
- player1_recent_marathon       # Recently played 3+ hour match?
- player2_recent_marathon
- player1_total_sets_played     # Volume in last 2 weeks
- player2_total_sets_played
- stamina_advantage             # Who's fresher?
- best_of_5_experience          # Grand Slam stamina
- tiebreak_record_p1            # Clutch performance
- tiebreak_record_p2
```

**Why Important:**
- Marathon matches affect recovery
- Some players excel in long matches
- Best-of-5 requires different stamina

---

### 8. Career Stage & Experience
**Source:** Can derive from age and match history

```python
- player1_career_matches        # Total career matches
- player2_career_matches
- experience_gap                # Experience difference
- player1_prime_age             # Age 24-29 typically peak
- player2_prime_age
- veteran_factor_p1             # Age 32+ with experience
- veteran_factor_p2
- rising_star_p1                # Young + improving rank
- rising_star_p2
- comeback_from_injury_p1       # Recently returned from break
- comeback_from_injury_p2
```

**Why Important:**
- Experience matters in big moments
- Age affects but isn't linear (old model used age_diff, had 0 importance)
- Prime years (25-29) are peak performance

## üé≤ Medium Priority Features (Worth Testing)

### 9. Time of Year / Season Context
```python
- month_of_year                 # 1-12
- season_phase                  # Start/Mid/End of season
- clay_court_season             # April-June
- hard_court_season             # Jan-Mar, Aug-Oct
- grass_court_season            # June-July
- surface_season_match          # Playing surface in its season
```

### 10. Tournament Prestige & Stakes
```python
- tournament_total_prize_money  
- ranking_points_for_winner
- prestige_score                # Grand Slam=4, Masters=3, etc.
- home_tournament_p1            # Playing in home country
- home_tournament_p2
```

### 11. Weather & Court Conditions (if available)
```python
- court_speed_index             # Fast/Medium/Slow
- altitude                      # High altitude = faster
- indoor_factor                 # Different ball behavior
- temperature                   # Heat affects performance
```

---

## ‚ùå Features to Remove/Skip

Based on old model analysis (zero importance):

```python
# Don't bother with these:
- player_height                 # Had ZERO importance
- height_difference
- player_taller
- handedness features           # All had ZERO importance
- lefty indicators
- age_diff (static)             # Use age trajectory instead
```

## üéØ Expected Accuracy Improvement

| Phase | Features | Expected Accuracy |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Old Model | 110 | 64.9% |
| Phase 1 (Betting + Stats) | 150 | 67-70% |
| Phase 2 (Context + Surface) | 180 | 70-72% |
