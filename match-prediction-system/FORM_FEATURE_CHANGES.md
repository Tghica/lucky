# Form Feature Changes - Individual Match Outcomes

## Summary
Changed the form calculation from **aggregated win percentage** to **20 individual binary features** representing the outcome of each of the last 10 matches for both players.

## Previous Implementation
- **Single feature per player**: `player1_form`, `player2_form`
- **Value**: Win percentage (0-100) over last 10 matches
- **Example**: 70.0 means player won 7 out of last 10 matches
- **Total form features**: 2 + 4 auxiliary = 6 features

## New Implementation
- **Individual match outcomes**: `player1_match_1` through `player1_match_10`, `player2_match_1` through `player2_match_10`
- **Values**: 
  - `1` = Won the match
  - `0` = Lost the match
  - `NaN` → `0` (filled) = No match data available (player hasn't played that many matches yet)
- **Ordering**: `match_1` is the most recent match, `match_10` is the oldest
- **Total individual features**: 20 (10 per player)

### Additional Aggregated Features
Created from the individual matches for derived insights:
1. `player1_form_wins`, `player2_form_wins`: Count of wins in last 10 matches (0-10)
2. `form_win_diff`: Difference in win counts between players
3. `player1_recent_form`, `player2_recent_form`: Wins in last 3 matches (0-3)
4. `recent_form_diff`: Difference in recent form
5. `player1_momentum`, `player2_momentum`: Form wins × (Elo / 1500)
6. `momentum_diff`: Difference in momentum

**Total form features**: 20 individual + 9 aggregated = **29 features**

## Feature Count Comparison
| Version | Form Features | Total Features |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Previous** | 6 | 49 |
| **New** | 29 | **68** |

## Benefits of New Approach

### 1. **Temporal Granularity**
- **Before**: "Player won 70% of last 10 matches" (no sequence information)
- **After**: "Won, Lost, Won, Won, Lost, Won, Won, Won, Lost, Won" (full sequence)
- Model can learn patterns like:
  - Win streaks vs. alternating results
  - Recent momentum (last 3 matches weighted more)
  - Recovery from losing streaks

### 2. **Better Handling of Limited Data**
- **Before**: Player with 5 matches gets 50% form if won 2.5, but only had 5 matches
- **After**: `match_1`-`match_5` have real data (0/1), `match_6`-`match_10` = 0 (no data)
- Model can distinguish between "won 5 of 10" vs. "won 5 of 5"

### 3. **Recency Bias**
- Model can learn that `match_1` (most recent) is more predictive than `match_10` (oldest)
- Tree-based models (XGBoost) excel at learning feature importance hierarchies

### 4. **Interaction Patterns**
- Model can detect complex patterns:
  - "If both players won last 3 matches → competitive match"
  - "If player1 lost last 2 but won 8 of 10 → temporary slump"
  - "If player2 alternates W-L-W-L → inconsistent performer"

## Code Changes

### 1. `calculator.py` - `calculate_form()` method
**Changed:**
- From: Aggregates last N matches into win percentage
- To: Stores individual match outcomes in chronological order
- Uses `deque.appendleft()` to maintain most recent first
- Returns 20 new columns instead of 6

### 2. `feature_engineering.py` - `create_form_features()` method
**Changed:**
- From: Creates difference and momentum features from percentages
- To: 
  - Keeps individual match columns (20 features)
  - Computes aggregated metrics (form_wins, recent_form, momentum)
  - Creates 9 derived features

### 3. `feature_engineering.py` - `handle_missing_values()` method
**Added:**
- Special handling for `player1_match_N` and `player2_match_N` columns
- Fills NaN with 0 (meaning "no match data") instead of median
- Logged separately for transparency

## Data Files Updated

### `data/processed/match_info.csv`
- Added 20 new columns: `player1_match_1` through `player2_match_10`
- Removed old columns: `player1_form`, `player2_form`, `player1_form_wins`, etc.

### `data/processed/train_features.csv`
- Shape: **(53,201 rows × 68 features)** ← was 49 features
- New features: 20 individual matches + 9 aggregated form metrics

### `data/processed/test_features.csv`
- Shape: **(13,301 rows × 67 features)** ← was 48 features
- Note: One fewer feature due to missing surface category in test set

## Value Distribution
Based on full dataset (66,502 matches):

| Value | Count | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `1.0` | 33,202 | Match won |
| `0.0` | 32,411 | Match lost |
| `NaN` → `0` | 889 | No data (filled with 0) |

**Interpretation:**
- ~889 NaN values means ~1.3% of match slots have no data
- Most common for early-career players or `match_10` (oldest in window)

## Next Steps

### 1. **Retrain Models**
```bash
python3 train_quick.py
```
Expected outcome:
- Model should learn to weight recent matches more heavily
- Accuracy may improve 1-3% due to better temporal information
- Feature importance will show which match positions matter most

### 2. **Feature Importance Analysis**
After retraining, check:
- Which match positions (`match_1` vs `match_10`) are most predictive?
- Are recent matches (`match_1`-`match_3`) more important?
- Do aggregated features (`form_win_diff`) outperform individual ones?

### 3. **Model Comparison**
Compare new model (68 features) vs. old model (49 features):
- Accuracy improvement
- AUC improvement
- Training time
- Overfitting risk (more features = more complexity)

## Example: Feature Values for a Match

### Player 1 (Roger Federer, experienced player)
```
match_1=1, match_2=1, match_3=0, match_4=1, match_5=1,
match_6=1, match_7=1, match_8=0, match_9=1, match_10=1
→ form_wins=8, recent_form=2 (won 2 of last 3)
```

### Player 2 (New player with only 4 matches)
```
match_1=1, match_2=0, match_3=1, match_4=0, match_5=0,
match_6=0, match_7=0, match_8=0, match_9=0, match_10=0
→ form_wins=2, recent_form=2 (won 2 of last 3)
```

**Model can now distinguish:**
- Player 1: Strong overall record (8/10) with recent dip (2/3)
- Player 2: Limited experience (only 4 matches), same recent form but weaker overall

## Technical Details

### Missing Value Handling
```python
# Individual match outcomes: NaN → 0 (no data)
for i in range(1, 11):
    df[f'player1_match_{i}'].fillna(0, inplace=True)
    df[f'player2_match_{i}'].fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Aggregated features: sum() with skipna=True
df['player1_form_wins'] = df[player1_match_cols].sum(axis=1, skipna=True)
```

### Chronological Order
```python
# deque maintains most recent first
player_match_history[player1].appendleft(winner == player1)

# match_1 = index 0 (most recent)
# match_10 = index 9 (oldest in window)
```

### Data Leakage Prevention
✅ **Safe**: Form calculated from matches BEFORE current match
- Uses `appendleft()` AFTER storing current match's form features
- Each row's form features are from matches that occurred before that match

**Next Action**: Run `python3 train_quick.py` to retrain models with new features
