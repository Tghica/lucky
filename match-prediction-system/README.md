# Match Prediction System

This project is designed to predict the outcomes of sports matches using machine learning techniques. It consists of several modules that handle data processing, model training, and prediction.

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd match-prediction-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your raw data and place it in the `data/raw` directory.
2. Run the data processing module to preprocess the data:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. Train the model using the processed data:
   ```
   python src/model_trainer/train.py
   ```

4. Use the prediction service to get match predictions:
   ```
   python src/predictor/prediction_service.py
   ```
