## 5. Performance Summary

### Best Individual Model: XGBoost Tuned
- ‚úÖ Test Accuracy: **64.87%**
- ‚úÖ Test AUC: **0.7109**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Overfitting: Train accuracy 5% higher than test

### Best Ensemble: Stacking
- ‚úÖ Test Accuracy: **64.93%** (slightly better)
- ‚úÖ Test AUC: **0.7115**
- ‚è±Ô∏è Training time: 10+ minutes

### Performance Ceiling:
- **Maximum accuracy achieved:** ~65%
- **Likely causes:**
  1. Data quality issues (duplicates, inconsistencies)
  2. Missing/incomplete ELO data for some players
  3. Feature engineering limitations
  4. Inherent unpredictability in tennis matches

---

## 6. Key Insights from Old Model

### What Worked:
1. ‚úÖ XGBoost with careful tuning
2. ‚úÖ Temporal split (avoided data leakage)
3. ‚úÖ ELO-based features (general, surface, tournament)
4. ‚úÖ Ensemble methods (marginal improvement)

### What Didn't Work Well:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Calibration (minimal improvement)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex ensembles (high training time, small gains)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Couldn't break 65% accuracy ceiling

### Areas for Improvement with New Data:
1. üéØ Better data quality (clean source)
2. üéØ More complete ELO coverage
3. üéØ Additional features (betting odds, head-to-head)
4. üéØ Better handling of new players
5. üéØ More training data (2000-2025 vs limited range)

## 7. Recommended Parameters for New Training

Based on old results, start with these XGBoost parameters:

```python
xgb_params = {
    'n_estimators': 700,
    'max_depth': 3,
    'learning_rate': 0.03,
    'subsample': 0.7,
    'colsample_bytree': 0.8,
    'gamma': 0.2,
    'min_child_weight': 5,
    'reg_alpha': 0.01,
    'reg_lambda': 1.5,
    'random_state': 42,
    'n_jobs': -1
}
```

### Then tune further with:
- Increase n_estimators (700 ‚Üí 1000) if we have more data
- Adjust learning_rate (0.03 ‚Üí 0.01-0.05) for better convergence
- Consider max_depth (3 ‚Üí 4-5) with more features

## 8. Expected Improvements with New Data

With clean data from Jeff Sackmann + 2025 updates:

### Conservative Estimate:
- Accuracy: 65% ‚Üí **67-70%**
- AUC: 0.71 ‚Üí **0.73-0.76**

### Optimistic Estimate (if all goes well):
- Accuracy: 65% ‚Üí **70-73%**
- AUC: 0.71 ‚Üí **0.76-0.80**

### Factors That Will Help:
1. ‚úÖ Clean, consistent data (no duplicates)
2. ‚úÖ Complete ELO coverage (all players)
3. ‚úÖ More training samples (~60K vs ~66K before)
4. ‚úÖ Better features (betting odds for calibration)
5. ‚úÖ Proper temporal ordering
